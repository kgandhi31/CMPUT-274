Assignment #1: OO Classifier

Running Instructions:
	1. The "ooclassifier.py" file can be tested via
	"from ooclassifier import *" entered in another python file.
	2. Open a terminal on Linux and change the directory to the one
	containing the "ooclassifier.py", the other python file, and the
	training data text file.
	2. Run the following command: 
	"python3 <other_python_filename> <training_data_filename>.

Assumptions:
	1. For the preprocessing in the classifier, if a mode entered does not
	match "keep-digits" or "keep-stops" or "keep-symbols", then full
	preprocessing will occur.
	2. For the "target_top_n" method, if a tie occurs at the num-th	rank,
	then it is assumed that all of the words with the same frequency of the
	num-th rank are also included in the new list of target words.
	Therefore, it is possible to have more than "num" new target words.

Notes:
	1. The frequency of all the words in the training instances that is
	calculated by the "target_top_n" method is based on if the training
	dataset has been preprocessed or not.
	2. Since "ClassifyByTopN" is a subclass of "ClassifyByTarget", it
	supports all of the existing methods of the class "ClassifyByTarget".
	3. Future optimizations of deepcopy should reduce time or space
	efficiency issues.
	4. For the "return_nfolds" method, it is possible that the folds are
	not exactly equal in size. They can be off-by-one if "num" does not
	divide evenly into the number of training instances.
	5. The interface or semantics of any of the existing methods and
	attributes of the existing classes did not change.
