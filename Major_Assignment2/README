Assignment #2: Huffman Coding

Running Instructions:
	1. Copy the "util.py" file to the directory containing "huffman.py",
	"bitio.py", "compress.py", and "decompress.py" files, and the
	"wwwroot" directory.
	2. Open a terminal on Linux and change to the directory containing
	all those files and the "wwwroot" directory.
	3. To compress files, run the following command:
		"python3 compress.py <file1> <file2> ..."
	4. To decompress files, run the following command:
		"python3 decompress.py <file1> <file2> ..."
	5. In steps 3 and 4, "<file1> <file2> ..." should be replaced by the
	names of the files to be compressed or decompressed, and must exist in
	the current directory of all the previously stated files and directory.
	6. To compress a file using the "wwwroot" directory, open a terminal
	in this directory and run the following command:
		"python3 ../compress.py somefile.ext"
		-> Here, "somefile" is the name of the file to compress and ".ext"
		is the extension.
		-> Open a browser and go to the url
		"http://localhost:8000/somefile.ext" to view and/ or download the
		decompressed file.
	7. To decompress a file using the "wwwroot" directory, open a terminal
	in this directory and run the following command:
		"python3 ../webserver.py"
		->	Open a browser and go to the url "http://localhost:8000". The
		decompressor is successful if the webpage is visible and the image
		of Huffman appears.

Assumptions:
	1. A valid stream is used for all the functions in the "util.py" file.
	The program was not created to handle an invalid stream.
	2. For the "decompress" function, the "compressed" file has the
	extension ".huf" and contains None, indicating the end-of-file.

Notes:
	1. For the "compress" function, None is written to the "compressed"
	file so that end-of-file symbol exists for the "decompress" function.
	2. After None is written to the "compressed" file, the "flush"
	function is called to write out any partial bytes to the file.
	3. If step 3 is executed in the running instructions, the compressed
	versions of the orginal files named "<file1>.huf <file2>.huf ..." will
	be created in the in the current directory of all the previously
	stated files and directory.
	4. If step 4 is executed in the running instructions, the decompressed
	versions of the orginal files named "<file1> <file2> ..." will be
	created in the in the current directory of all the previously stated
	files and directory.
